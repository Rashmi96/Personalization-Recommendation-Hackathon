## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered financial assistant** designed to:
- Provide **personalized financial insights** based on customer demographics and transaction history.
- Recommend suitable financial products such as **Credit Cards, Home Loans, and Personal Loans**.
- Predict loan amounts and credit limits using machine learning models.
- Serve as a Flask-based **API and web interface** for user-friendly interactions.

## Features
- **Customer Segmentation**: Uses **K-Means clustering** to group customers.
- **Product Recommendation**: Predicts the best financial product using a **Multi-Output Classifier**.
- **Loan/Credit Limit Prediction**: Estimates loan amounts & credit limits using **Random Forest Regressors**.
- **Financial Insights Generation**: Generates **natural language insights** with **LLM (Hugging Face Transformer Model)**.
- **Flask Web API**: Provides an interface for insights & recommendations.

## Data Generation
This project generates **synthetic customer data** using `Faker`. It includes:
### 1. Customer Demographics
   - Name, age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, salary, etc.
### 2. Financial Behavior
   - Loan amount, credit utilization, EMI paid, tenure, default status, credit limit.
### 3. Enquiries Data (Last 3 months)
   - Recent credit inquiries, product type, amount, approval/rejection status.
### 4. Transaction History (Past 6 months)
   - Transaction descriptions, account balance, salary credits, hobby-based spending.

## Technologies Used
- **Python (Flask)** – Web framework for API and frontend.
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data processing and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn** – ML models for clustering, classification, and regression.
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – AI-generated financial insights.
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization (for development and testing).
- **Joblib** – Model persistence.

## Machine Learning Pipeline
### 1. Pre-trained Models
   - `KMeans`: Customer segmentation.
   - `StandardScaler`: Data normalization.
   - `MultiOutputClassifier`: Predicts product suitability.
   - `RandomForestRegressor`: Predicts loan amounts & credit limits.
### 2. LLM-Based Insights
   - Uses a **fine-tuned transformer model** for personalized financial insights.
### 3. Flask Web Application
   - Accepts customer data and returns **product recommendations & financial insights**.
